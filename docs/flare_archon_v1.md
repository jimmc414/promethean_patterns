This is **FLARE-ARCHON v1.0 **.

---

### A. Core Philosophy (for v1.0)

FLARE-ARCHON is a declarative meta-language for **digital sociogenesis**. Its purpose is not merely to script or govern agents, but to define the foundational constitution of a resilient, evolving, multi-agent system capable of pursuing complex, long-running objectives with minimal human intervention. It models the system as a miniature society with an explicit economy, structured knowledge, adaptable roles, and formal processes for self-amendment.

It establishes:
1.  **Identity and Purpose (`role`)**: What an agent is and why it exists.
2.  **Organization and Trust (`team`, `policy`)**: How agents collaborate and what rules they must obey.
3.  **Economy and Incentive (`treasury`)**: The resource constraints and reward structures that drive behavior.
4.  **Process and State (`initiative`)**: How work is defined, tracked, and verified.
5.  **Memory and Learning (`codex`)**: How institutional knowledge is captured, shared, and refined.
6.  **Evolution and Adaptation (`amendment`)**: How the society can modify its own constitution.

The language is intended for a human **Architect** to write the initial constitution, which is then enforced and executed by a master runtime known as the **Arbiter**.

```

### C. System Contracts & Artifacts (v1.0 Final)

#### 1. Tasking Order (Arbiter -> Agent)
When the Arbiter assigns a task from an initiative's state machine, it issues a signed Tasking Order.

```json
{
  "task_id": "task-uuid-1234",
  "initiative_id": "GenerateMongoliaReport",
  "state": "FactFinding",
  "task_mandate": "Find and synthesize verifiable facts from trusted web sources about the Mongolian economy.",
  "inputs": {
    "topic": "Mongolian economy",
    "required_facts": ["GDP", "main exports", "population"]
  },
  "constraints": {
    "max_spend": "50 credits",
    "max_duration": "1h"
  }
}
```

#### 2. Agent Report (Agent -> Arbiter)
Upon task completion (or failure), the agent submits a signed Report.

```json
{
  "report_id": "report-uuid-5678",
  "task_id": "task-uuid-1234",
  "creator_role": "Researcher",
  "status": "success",
  "output": {
    "gdp": "approx $14 billion",
    "exports": ["coal", "copper", "livestock"],
    "population": "approx 3.3 million"
  },
  "rationale": "Used web_search_pro on 3 primary sources... Synthesized findings... Discarded one source as unreliable.",
  "provenance": {
    "actions_taken": [
      { "tool": "web_search_pro", "args": {"query": "..."}, "cost": "15 credits", "output_hash": "..."}
    ],
    "resource_spend": "15.02 credits" // 15 for tool + 0.02 for model
  },
  "signature": "..." // Agent's cryptographic signature
}
```
This report allows the Arbiter to update the initiative's state, debit the treasury, and maintain a verifiable audit trail.

### D. Detailed Examples in FLARE-ARCHON

#### Example 1: Self-Improving Software Engineering Firm

This illustrates the entire lifecycle from execution to evolution.

```flare-archon
# == FOUNDATIONAL SETUP ==
treasury {
  token_name: "ComputeUnit"
  initial_allocation: { DevTeam: 10000 ComputeUnit }
  reward_pool: 50000 ComputeUnit
  reward_rules: { "on initiative.done_when": 250 ComputeUnit } # Reward on success
}

codex SecurityKnowledgeBase {
  schema: "schemas/cve_entry.json"
  governed_by: SecurityAnalyst
  entry_cost: 5 ComputeUnit
}

policy NoDirectCommits {
  description: "Code cannot be committed without passing tests and being reviewed.";
  rule: tool.name == "git_commit" && !state.is(TestsPassed, ReviewApproved);
  penalty: fine 100 ComputeUnit;
}

# == ROLES AND TEAM ==

role Tester { mandate: "..."; capabilities: [gpt4, python_executor]; ... }
role Reviewer { mandate: "..."; capabilities: [gpt4]; ... }

# An agent that monitors performance and can propose system changes.
role DevOps_Monitor {
  mandate: "Monitor system efficiency. Propose constitutional amendments to improve performance or security."
  capabilities: [gpt4, system_log_reader]
  protocols: { reports(anomalies to Architect) }
}

team DevTeam is hierarchy managed_by Reviewer with [Coder, Tester];

# == THE WORK ==
initiative FixAuthBug {
  goal: "Fix auth bug in issue #451 and add CVE-2023-1234 to our knowledge base.";
  assigned_to: DevTeam;
  initial_state: WritingCode;
  done_when: github:issue_is_closed(#451) && codex.has_entry("CVE-2023-1234");
  
  state_machine: {
    state WritingCode {
      task: "Write code to patch the bug described in the issue.";
      transition to RunningTests on artifact.created(type="*.py");
    }
    state RunningTests {
      task: "Execute tests against the new code.";
      transition to CodeReadyForReview on test.result == "pass";
      transition to WritingCode on test.result == "fail";
    }
    state CodeReadyForReview {
      task: "Review code for style and logic. If ok, approve.";
      transition to ReviewApproved on review.approved == true;
    }
    state ReviewApproved {
      task: "Commit the final code.";
      # Note: Policy allows commit only when prior states are met.
      transition to AddKnowledge on tool.success("git_commit");
    }
    state AddKnowledge {
      task: "Document CVE-2023-1234 in the SecurityKnowledgeBase codex.";
      # Final state. done_when condition will now be checked by the Arbiter.
    }
  }
}

# == THE EVOLUTION ==
# The DevOps_Monitor, after observing several initiatives being slowed down by
# a lack of automated security scanning, proposes a change.
amendment AddScannerRole {
  proposed_by: DevOps_Monitor
  description: "Introduce an automated SecurityScanner role to the DevTeam to catch vulnerabilities before human review, speeding up the cycle."
  modifies: team DevTeam
  changeset: { "add_role": "SecurityScanner" }
  voting: { quorum: 50%, threshold: 66% } # Requires majority of roles to vote.
}
```
**Execution:** The Arbiter receives the `AddScannerRole` proposal. It notifies all existing roles, who can autonomously vote based on their mandates (e.g., the Reviewer might vote 'yes' because it reduces its workload). If the vote passes, the Arbiter permanently modifies the `DevTeam` definition for all future initiatives. The system has learned and adapted.

### E. The Arbiter's Mandate

The Arbiter is the runtime engine responsible for:
1.  **Instantiation**: Reading the manifest and instantiating all roles, teams, and the treasury.
2.  **State Execution**: Driving initiatives forward by issuing Tasking Orders based on state transitions.
3.  **Economic Ledger**: Acting as the banker, debiting costs from accounts for tool/model usage and crediting rewards based on `treasury` rules.
4.  **Policy Enforcement**: Intercepting all actions (especially tool calls) and checking them against all active `policy` rules. It applies penalties as defined.
5.  **Protocol Mediation**: Serving as the message bus for inter-agent communication, ensuring `requests` and `reports` follow the defined `protocols`.
6.  **Constitutional Clerk**: Managing the `amendment` process, including tabulating votes and applying successful changesets to the in-memory constitution.
7.  **Provenance Authority**: Stamping and storing all artifacts and reports, ensuring a complete, verifiable audit log of the entire system's history.

### F. Final Verdict (Self-Assessed)

FLARE-ARCHON v1.0 is a complete specification for a new class of AI systems. It moves beyond simple execution to create a self-regulating, economically-driven, and evolvable agentic society. By providing a language to define not just workflows but the very "laws of physics" for this digital world—its economy, politics, and rules of knowledge—it lays the groundwork for creating truly autonomous systems that can tackle complex, persistent problems with sophistication and resilience. The design is frozen and ready for implementation.
