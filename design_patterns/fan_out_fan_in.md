# PATTERN: The Fan-Out/Fan-In

> **Intent:** To process multiple pieces of data or a single piece of data from multiple perspectives concurrently, and then aggregate the individual results into a final, synthesized response.

---

## 1. Context & Motivation

Some problems are "embarrassingly parallel." For example, when analyzing a code change, one might want to assess its impact on security, performance, and documentation simultaneously. Running these analyses sequentially in an `Assembly Line` would be slow and inefficient, as they do not depend on each other.

Similarly, when processing a large volume of independent data (like summarizing 100 different articles), there is no reason to process them one by one.

**The Fan-Out/Fan-In** pattern addresses this by splitting a task into multiple independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel (**Fan-Out**), and then combines their outputs using a final "reducer" or "aggregator" agent (**Fan-In**). This mirrors the MapReduce paradigm from big data, adapted for LLM-based analysis and synthesis.

## 2. Applicability & Use Cases

This pattern is the premier solution for tasks that are either divisible into independent chunks or require multi-faceted analysis.

Use this pattern when:
-   You need to perform the same operation on many independent items (e.g., summarizing a list of articles).
-   You need to perform *different* analyses on the *same* item, and these analyses are not dependent on each other (e.g., security, performance, and style checks on a piece of code).
-   Throughput and reduced latency are critical, and the task can be parallelized.
-   You need a comprehensive, synthesized view derived from multiple, diverse perspectives.

**Examples:**
-   **Multi-Perspective Code Review (as described):** `Fan-Out:` A single code file is sent to three parallel LLM agents: `Security Specialist`, `Performance Specialist`, and `Style Linter`. `Fan-In:` Their individual reports (JSON) are passed to a final `Lead Reviewer` agent that synthesizes them into a single, prioritized review summary.
-   **Batch Data Processing:** `Fan-Out:` An array of 100 customer reviews is distributed among 10 parallel `Sentiment Analyzer` agents (10 reviews each). `Fan-In:` The 10 sets of sentiment scores are passed to a `Report Generator` agent that calculates aggregate statistics (e.g., overall satisfaction, common themes).
-   **Hypothesis Generation:** `Fan-Out:` A single problem statement is sent to multiple "persona" agents: `The Optimist`, `The Pessimist`, `The Pragmatist`, `The Innovator`. Each generates solutions from its unique perspective. `Fan-In:` Their diverse ideas are sent to a `Strategist` agent that identifies the most promising and robust options from the collected viewpoints.

    class Worker1, Worker2, Worker3 worker;
    classDef reducer fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    class FanIn reducer;
```

**Participants:**
-   **The Orchestrator:** The main script or application. It is responsible for the `Fan-Out` logic (distributing the work) and the `Fan-In` logic (waiting for all parallel tasks to complete before calling the final reducer). This typically requires asynchronous programming (`async/await`, goroutines, or parallel shell execution).
-   **The Distributor (Fan-Out Logic):** Part of the Orchestrator that splits the initial data or task into chunks for the parallel workers.
-   **The Parallel Workers:** A set of independent LLM agents that run concurrently. They can be homogeneous (all using the same prompt on different data) or heterogeneous (using different specialist prompts on the same data).
-   **The Aggregator (Fan-In Logic / Reducer):** The final LLM agent in the pattern. Its role is to take the collected outputs from all parallel workers and synthesize them into a single, coherent result. Its prompt is designed specifically for summarization, aggregation, or prioritization.

## 4. Collaboration & Dynamics

The pattern operates in three distinct phases managed by the Orchestrator.

1.  **Phase 1: Fan-Out (Distribution)**
    -   The Orchestrator receives the initial data and task.
    -   The Distributor logic prepares the inputs for each parallel worker. This might involve splitting an array into sub-arrays or creating multiple copies of a single input file.
    -   The Orchestrator launches the LLM calls for all Parallel Workers *concurrently*, without waiting for any single one to finish.

2.  **Phase 2: Parallel Processing (Map)**
    -   Each Parallel Worker executes its specialized task on its given piece of data.
    -   The Orchestrator waits asynchronously for all workers to complete, collecting their individual results. Robust implementations will include timeouts to handle unresponsive workers.

3.  **Phase 3: Fan-In (Reduce)**
    -   Once all workers have returned their results, the Orchestrator assembles them into a single data structure (e.g., an array of JSON objects).
    -   The Orchestrator invokes the final **Aggregator** agent, passing it the complete collection of results. The Aggregator's prompt will be something like, "Given this array of expert analyses, produce a single, prioritized action plan."
    -   The output of the Aggregator is the final result of the entire pattern.

## 5. Consequences & Trade-offs

-   **Benefits:**
    -   `Massive Performance Gain:` For divisible or multi-faceted tasks, this pattern drastically reduces end-to-end latency compared to sequential processing.
    -   `Enhanced Quality through Diversity:` Using multiple specialist "personas" (like in the hypothesis generation example) can produce more creative, robust, and well-rounded insights than a single model could.
    -   `Scalability:` The pattern scales naturally. To process more data, one can simply add more parallel workers (up to the limits of the underlying LLM API rate limits and orchestrator hardware).

-   **Trade-offs / Risks:**
    -   `Implementation Complexity:` Requires asynchronous programming and state management for concurrent processes, which is significantly more complex than a simple sequential script.
    -   `Cost:` This pattern can be expensive, as it involves multiple simultaneous LLM calls. The cost scales linearly with the number of parallel workers.
    -   `Aggregator Bottleneck:` The entire process is only as good as the final `Aggregator` agent. If the Aggregator's prompt is not well-designed, it may fail to properly synthesize the rich inputs from the parallel workers, wasting the effort of the Fan-Out phase.
    -   `Rate Limiting:` Making many concurrent calls can easily hit API rate limits, requiring the orchestrator to include logic for throttling, backoff, and retries.

## 6. Reference Implementation

A shell-based implementation showcases the concept, using background processes for concurrency.

### Advanced Fan-Out/Fan-In Patterns

**1. Dynamic Worker Allocation:**
```bash
# Distribute work based on data size
distribute_work() {
  local items=("$@")
  local num_workers=$((${#items[@]} / 10 + 1))  # 10 items per worker
  local worker_id=0
  
  for item in "${items[@]}"; do
    worker_dir="$TEMP_DIR/worker_$((worker_id % num_workers))"
    mkdir -p "$worker_dir"
    echo "$item" >> "$worker_dir/items.txt"
    ((worker_id++))
  done
  
  echo "$num_workers"
}
```

**2. Heterogeneous Workers with Different Prompts:**
```bash
# Different analysis perspectives
declare -A PERSPECTIVES=(
  ["optimist"]="Find all the positive aspects and potential"
  ["pessimist"]="Identify all risks and potential failures"
  ["pragmatist"]="Focus on practical implementation challenges"
  ["innovator"]="Suggest creative improvements and alternatives"
)

for perspective in "${!PERSPECTIVES[@]}"; do
  analyze_with_perspective "$perspective" "${PERSPECTIVES[$perspective]}" &
done
```

**3. Hierarchical Fan-Out/Fan-In:**
```bash
# Two-level fan-out for large datasets
# Level 1: Distribute to regional processors
for region in "north" "south" "east" "west"; do
  (
    # Level 2: Each region fans out to cities
    for city in $(get_cities "$region"); do
      process_city_data "$city" &
    done
    wait
    
    # Regional aggregation
    aggregate_region "$region"
  ) &
done
wait

# Global aggregation
aggregate_global
```

**4. Fallback for Failed Workers:**
```bash
# Track and retry failed workers
process_with_retry() {
  local worker_id=$1
  local max_retries=3
  local retry=0
  
  while [ $retry -lt $max_retries ]; do
    if run_worker "$worker_id"; then
      return 0
    fi
    ((retry++))
    sleep $((2 ** retry))  # Exponential backoff
  done
  
  # Use fallback if all retries fail
  echo "{\"worker\": \"$worker_id\", \"status\": \"failed\", \"fallback\": true}" > "$TEMP_DIR/${worker_id}.json"
}
```

### Composing with Other Patterns

The Fan-Out/Fan-In pattern combines powerfully with other patterns:

```bash
# Fan-Out + Router: Different workers based on data type
classify_and_process() {
  local item=$1
  local type=$(echo "$item" | ./router.sh)
  
  case "$type" in
    "text") process_text "$item" ;;
    "code") process_code "$item" ;;
    "data") process_data "$item" ;;
  esac
}

# Fan-Out + Circuit Breaker: Protected parallel execution
for worker in "${WORKERS[@]}"; do
  (
    ./circuit_breaker.sh "$worker" "$PROMPT" "$DATA" > "$TEMP_DIR/${worker}.json"
  ) &
done
```

The Fan-Out/Fan-In pattern enables efficient parallel processing and multi-perspective analysis, transforming how we approach complex LLM orchestration tasks that benefit from concurrent execution.
