# **The Promethean Cookbook (Final Comprehensive Edition)**

**A Complete Guide to Foundational Primitives, Practical Techniques, and Advanced Recipes for LLM Orchestration**

## **Introduction: From Patterns to Primitives**

The **Promethean Patterns Guide** describes the high-level *architecture* for building robust LLM-driven systems. This **Cookbook** provides the low-level *tactics*â€”the individual tools, prompt structures, and command-line recipes required to implement those patterns effectively.

This guide is built on one core realization: **a command-line LLM is a new kind of Unix primitive**. It reads from standard input, processes based on its prompt (its "arguments"), and writes to standard output. By mastering the primitives of both prompting (`STRUCTURED_INTERFACE`) and shell orchestration (`ORCHESTRATION_LOGIC`), you can build systems of remarkable power and complexity.

## **Part 1: The Core Principles of LLM Interaction**

Understanding *why* these techniques work is essential. The LLM is not executing code; it is performing sophisticated pattern recognition based on its training on vast amounts of code, documentation, and technical writing.

### **1.1. The Operator's Mental Model**

-   **Contract Fulfillment:** When you provide a structured format like JSON in your prompt, the LLM treats it as a strict API contract. Its highest priority becomes fulfilling this contract, which is why structured output is so reliable.

-   **Role-Based Specialization:** A role (`You are a cybersecurity analyst`) primes the model, focusing its attention and activating the specific knowledge relevant to that domain.

-   **Inferred Intent from Schema:** The model decodes your intent from the structure you provide:
    -   `"action": "test" | "build"` infers an `enum`, forcing a choice.
    -   `"next_file": "path or null"` infers an `iterator` or linked list, hinting at control flow.
    -   `"confidence_score": float` infers a need for self-assessment.
    -   `"if_approved": {...}` infers a conditional block pattern.

-   **The Unix Philosophy as Training Data:** The LLM has been trained on decades of examples where small, single-purpose command-line tools are piped together. By using `|`, `>` and other shell operators, you are placing your LLM call within a familiar context, and it adapts its behavior accordingly.

### **1.2. The Foundational Technique: Structured Output**

The cornerstone of all Promethean Patterns is commanding the LLM to respond in a machine-readable format.

**The Basic Prompt Structure:**
```bash
claude -p "You are a [ROLE]. Output [FORMAT]: [SCHEMA_DEFINITION]"
```

**Example:**
```bash
claude -p "You are a code analyzer. Output JSON: {analysis: ..., next_file: ...}"
```

**Why This Works So Well (The Four Pillars):**
1.  **Eliminates Parsing Ambiguity:** The output is machine-readable `application/json`, not unpredictable natural language prose. This allows direct, reliable parsing with tools like `jq` or `json.loads()`.
2.  **Enforces Type and Shape Safety:** The schema (`{key: type}`) acts as a contract. The orchestrator knows exactly what fields and data types to expect, reducing runtime errors.
3.  **Enables Composability:** The structured output of one LLM call can be reliably piped as the structured input to another, forming the basis for the **Assembly Line** pattern.
4.  **Acts as Self-Documentation:** The prompt itself clearly documents the expected data structure of the LLM agent's response.

### **1.3. The Prompt "Verbs": A Command Vocabulary**

Using strong, imperative verbs turns your prompt from a question into a command. This vocabulary is the tactical toolkit for building the master prompts used in all Promethean Patterns.

#### **Output & Formatting Commands**
-   `Output JSON: {key: type}` - The most common and reliable method.
-   `Format as: markdown table with columns: ...` - For human-readable reports.
-   `Render as: ASCII diagram` - For visualizations.
-   `Generate: YAML configuration` - For structured, non-JSON output.
-   `Produce:`, `Emit:` - Alternative formatting verbs.

#### **Transformation & Analysis Commands**
-   `Convert to: TypeScript` - For code translation.
-   `Rewrite as: functional style` - For refactoring.
-   `Extract: all email addresses as a JSON array` - For entity extraction.
-   `Identify: security vulnerabilities as {type, severity}` - For targeted analysis.
-   `Transform into:`, `Express as:`, `Translate to:` - Variations for different contexts.

#### **Behavioral & Control Flow Commands**
-   `Act as: a Python REPL` - To simulate another program.
-   `Decide: which files need review` - To guide `The Router` pattern.
-   `Judge: code quality on a scale of 1-10` - For scoring and ranking.
-   `For each function: output a JSON object` - For iterative processing on input.
-   `Behave like:`, `Simulate:`, `Emulate:` - For system impersonation.
-   `Choose:`, `Determine:`, `Evaluate to:`, `Classify as:` - For decision making.

#### **Constraint Modifiers**
-   `Only output:`, `Exclusively return:`, `Limit response to:` - For pure, non-verbose output.
-   `Restrict to:`, `Limit to:` - Additional constraint variations.

## **Part 2: The Orchestrator's Toolkit (The Unix Philosophy)**

These are the shell primitives used by your orchestrator scripts to manage data flow and implement `EXTERNAL_STATE`.

### **2.1. Standard I/O: The Pipes of Communication**

-   **Pipe `|`**: Chains commands. The backbone of **The Assembly Line**.
    ```bash
    cat code.py | claude -p "Extract..." | jq '.'
    ```

-   **Input Redirect `<`**: Feeds a file to `stdin`.
    ```bash
    claude -p "Summarize..." < notes.txt
    ```

-   **Output Redirects `>` & `>>`**: Saves or appends output to a file.
    ```bash
    claude -p "Analyze..." > analysis.log
    claude -p "Format as log entry" >> system.log
    ```

-   **Here-String `<<<`**: Feeds a short string to `stdin`.
    ```bash
    claude -p "Translate..." <<< "Hello, world!"
    ```

-   **Here-Document `<<EOF`**: The standard for multi-line strings or prompts within a script.
    ```bash
    PROMPT=$(cat <<EOF
    You are a specialist reviewer.
    The user will provide input below.
    Analyze it carefully.
    EOF
    )
    claude -p "$PROMPT" < data.txt
    ```

### **2.2. Advanced Process & File Handling**

-   **Command Substitution `$(...)`**: Captures a command's output to be used as a string argument.
    ```bash
    claude -p "Review this diff" "$(git diff)"
    ```

-   **Process Substitution `<(...)`**: Makes a command's output behave like a temporary file. Essential for tools like `diff` that require file paths.
    ```bash
    # Compare Python and JavaScript versions
    diff <(claude -p "Write a Python version...") <(claude -p "Write a JS version...")
    ```

-   **Named Pipes `mkfifo`**: Decouples processes. A long-running data source can write to the pipe, and an LLM consumer can read from it at its own pace.
    ```bash
    mkfifo /tmp/log_stream
    tail -f app.log > /tmp/log_stream &
    claude -p "Monitor this log stream..." < /tmp/log_stream
    ```

### **2.3. The `jq` Parser: The Key to State Management**

`jq` is the indispensable tool for interacting with the LLM's JSON output. It is how the orchestrator implements `EXTERNAL_STATE`.

-   **Reading State:** Extracting a single field to make a decision.
    ```bash
    DECISION=$(echo "$LLM_RESPONSE" | jq -r '.next_action')
    ```
    *(Used in the `Router` and `Recursive Inquisitor`)*

-   **Writing State:** Creating a new JSON object to send to the next LLM call.
    ```bash
    COMBINED_INPUT=$(jq -n --argjson analysis "$ANALYSIS_1" --argjson tests "$ANALYSIS_2" \
      '{ "code_analysis": $analysis, "test_cases": $tests }')
    ```
    *(Used in the `Fan-In` reducer and multi-stage `Assembly Line`)*

-   **Aggregating Data:** Combining multiple JSON files.
    ```bash
    AGGREGATED=$(jq -s . *.json)
    ```

-   **Validation:** Checking for the existence of required keys.
    ```bash
    if ! echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -e 'has("error")' >/dev/null; then
      echo "No error field found"
    fi
    ```
    *(Used in the `Circuit Breaker` and all robust implementations for `PROBABILISTIC_RESILIENCE`)*
