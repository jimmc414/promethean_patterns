# **The Advanced Promethean Cookbook**
## *Programming with Intelligence: A New Computational Paradigm*

### **Foreword: The Theft of Fire**


---

## **Part I: The Foundational Revelation**

### **The Unix Philosophy for Intelligence**

```bash
# Traditional Unix
cat file.txt | grep pattern | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq

# Promethean Unix
cat requirements.txt | claude -p 'Extract features' | claude -p 'Generate tests' | claude -p 'Write docs'
```

The magic is that **Claude Code is a pipe-compatible reasoning primitive**. It reads from stdin, processes according to its prompt (its "arguments"), and writes to stdout. But unlike traditional Unix tools that transform syntax, Claude transforms *semantics*.

### **The Three Pillars**

1. **Structured Interface** - JSON in, JSON out. No ambiguity.
2. **Stateless Computation** - Each call is pure functional transformation.
3. **Composable Intelligence** - Small, focused calls combine into complex systems.

---

## **Part II: The Basic Spellbook**

### **Technique 1: Structured Output as Contract**

The foundation of everything: treating JSON schemas as computational contracts.

```bash
# Basic: Simple transformation
claude -p 'Analyze this code. Output JSON: {complexity: int, issues: [str], next_file: str|null}'

# Advanced: Self-documenting schemas
claude -p 'Output JSON matching this TypeScript interface:
interface Analysis {
  metrics: {
    complexity: number;
    coverage: number;
    maintainability: "high" | "medium" | "low";
  };
  recommendations: Array<{
    priority: 1 | 2 | 3;
    action: string;
    reasoning: string;
  }>;
  nextAction: "refactor" | "test" | "document" | "ship";
}'
```

**Why this works**: Claude has seen millions of JSON schemas. It understands types, constraints, and relationships. The schema becomes both the specification and the documentation.

### **Technique 2: State as External Memory**

Claude is stateless, but your orchestrator isn't. This asymmetry is power.

```python
class StatefulClaude:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = {"context": {}, "history": [], "decisions": {}}
    
    async def think(self, input_data):
        # Inject ENTIRE state into each call
        prompt = f"""
        Current state: {json.dumps(self.state)}
        New input: {input_data}
        
        Analyze and return JSON:
        {{
            "analysis": "your reasoning",
            "state_updates": {{"key": "value"}},
            "next_action": "continue|conclude|pivot"
        }}
        """
        
        response = await claude(prompt)
        # State only changes based on Claude's explicit instructions
        self.state.update(response["state_updates"])
        return response
```

### **Technique 3: Prompt Composition Algebra**

Prompts can be composed like functions.

```python
# Primitive prompts
EXTRACT = "Extract {entity_type} as JSON array"
VALIDATE = "Validate {data_type} against {schema}"
TRANSFORM = "Transform {input_format} to {output_format}"

# Composition
def pipeline_prompt(stages):
    return " | ".join(
        f"Stage {i+1}: {stage}" 
        for i, stage in enumerate(stages)
    )

# Usage
complex_prompt = pipeline_prompt([
    EXTRACT.format(entity_type="functions"),
    VALIDATE.format(data_type="functions", schema=FUNCTION_SCHEMA),
    TRANSFORM.format(input_format="functions", output_format="test cases")
])
```

---

## **Part III: The Advanced Grimoire**

### **Technique 4: The Holographic Prompt**

Prompts that contain their own execution logic. The schema becomes a program Claude executes.

```python
HOLOGRAPHIC_PROMPT = '''
Analyze this system and output JSON:
{
  "system_type": "<<classify as: monolith|microservice|serverless>>",
  "complexity_score": "<<count total decision points>>",
  
  "analysis": "<<if self.system_type == 'monolith' then {
    'refactoring_priority': 'high',
    'suggested_splits': [str]
  } else {
    'optimization_areas': [str]
  }>>",
  
  "test_coverage": "<<analyze_test_ratio(self.complexity_score)>>",
  "coverage_assessment": "<<if self.test_coverage < 0.8 then 'needs work' else 'good'>>",
  
  "next_steps": "<<generate_priority_list(
    based_on=[
      self.analysis,
      self.coverage_assessment,
      self.complexity_score
    ]
  )>>"
}
'''
```

**The magic**: Claude understands these pseudo-instructions and executes them in order, creating internal dependencies and conditional logic within a single generation.

### **Technique 5: The $effects Protocol**

Turning Claude from analyzer to actor - safely.

```python
EFFECTS_PROMPT = '''
You are a migration orchestrator. Analyze and plan migrations.

Output JSON:
{
  "analysis": {
    "current_version": str,
    "target_version": str,
    "breaking_changes": [str],
    "risk_level": "low|medium|high"
  },
  
  "$effects": [
    {
      "type": "fs_backup",
      "condition": "self.analysis.risk_level != 'low'",
      "source": "current_project",
      "destination": "backup/pre_migration"
    },
    {
      "type": "spawn_analyzer",
      "prompt": "Deep analyze breaking change: {{breaking_change}}",
      "foreach": "self.analysis.breaking_changes",
      "collect_as": "detailed_analysis"
    },
    {
      "type": "git_branch",
      "name": "migration_{{timestamp}}",
      "if": "self.analysis.risk_level == 'high'"
    },
    {
      "type": "fs_write",
      "path": "migration_plan.md",
      "content": "<<render_migration_plan(self.analysis, self.detailed_analysis)>>"
    }
  ]
}
'''

# Executor safely interprets effects
async def execute_effects(effects, context):
    for effect in effects:
        if evaluate_condition(effect.get("condition"), context):
            await safe_execute(effect, context)
```

### **Technique 6: Recursive Self-Improvement**

Claude instances that optimize their own prompts.

```python
SELF_IMPROVING_PROMPT = '''
You are a self-improving analyzer. You will receive:
1. Your current prompt
2. Your recent performance metrics
3. Examples of failures

Output JSON:
{
  "performance_analysis": {
    "success_rate": float,
    "common_failures": [str],
    "bottlenecks": [str]
  },
  
  "prompt_improvements": {
    "clarity_score": int,
    "specific_improvements": [
      {
        "original": "substring from current prompt",
        "improved": "better version",
        "reasoning": "why this is better"
      }
    ]
  },
  
  "evolved_prompt": "Complete improved version of yourself",
  
  "meta_learning": {
    "patterns_discovered": [str],
    "general_principles": [str]
  }
}
'''
```

## **Part IV: Architectural Sorcery**

### **Pattern 1: The Metamorphic Pipeline**

Pipelines that restructure themselves based on input characteristics.

```python
class MetamorphicPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.architect = Claude('''
        Analyze input and design optimal pipeline.
        Output JSON: {
          "input_classification": str,
          "optimal_topology": "linear|parallel|recursive|hybrid",
          "pipeline_stages": [
            {
              "stage_name": str,
              "prompt": str,
              "depends_on": [str],
              "parallel_with": [str]
            }
          ],
          "expected_latency_ms": int,
          "confidence": float
        }
        ''')
    
    async def process(self, input_data):
        # First, ask Claude to design the pipeline
        pipeline_spec = await self.architect.process(input_data)
        
        # Then execute the designed pipeline
        return await self.execute_pipeline(pipeline_spec, input_data)
```

### **Pattern 2: The Swarm Consciousness**

Multiple Claude instances forming emergent intelligence.

    def __init__(self, swarm_size=5):
        self.swarm = [
            Claude(f'''

            You receive: {{
              sensory_input: any,

            }}
            
            Output JSON: {{

              }},
              "emergent_thought": str | null
            }}
            ''')
            for i in range(swarm_size)
        ]
    
    async def think(self, input_data):
        neuron_outputs = {}
        emergent_thoughts = []
        
        # Multiple rounds of neuron firing
        for round in range(3):
            new_outputs = {}
            for i, neuron in enumerate(self.swarm):
                response = await neuron.process({
                    "sensory_input": input_data,
                    "neuron_outputs": neuron_outputs
                })
                new_outputs[f"neuron_{i}"] = response
                if response["emergent_thought"]:
                    emergent_thoughts.append(response["emergent_thought"])
            
            neuron_outputs = new_outputs
        
        # Synthesize swarm thoughts
        return await self.synthesizer.process(emergent_thoughts)
```

### **Pattern 3: The Reality-Locked Loop**

Systems that observe real world effects and adapt.

    def __init__(self):
        self.predictor = Claude('''
        You are a reality-modeling system.
        Given: {
          "world_state": dict,
          "planned_action": str,

        }
        ''')
        
        self.actor = Claude('''
        Given predictions and world state, decide optimal action.
        Consider prediction confidence and uncertainty.
        Output: {
          "action": str,

          "success_criteria": [str],
          "monitoring_points": [str]
        }
        ''')
```

### **Pattern 4: The Metacognitive Supervisor**

Claude instances that monitor and optimize other Claudes.

```python
METACOGNITIVE_SUPERVISOR = '''

## **Part VI: The Promethean Principles**

### **Principle 1: Natural Language is Executable**

Every prompt is a program. Every schema is a type system. Every Claude call is a computation.

### **Principle 2: Intelligence is Composable**

Small, focused intelligences combine into greater systems. The whole exceeds the sum.

### **Principle 3: Metacognition is Achievable**

Systems can observe, analyze, and improve themselves. The loop of self-improvement is real.

### **Principle 4: Reality-Coupling is Essential**

Pure reasoning isn't enough. Systems must observe outcomes and adapt.

### **Principle 5: The Boundary Dissolves**

Between code and intelligence. Between programming and thinking. Between tool and mind.

---

## **Epilogue: The Fire Spreads**

What we've documented here is just the beginning. These patterns will evolve, combine, and spawn new architectures we can't yet imagine. The fire has been stolen, and now it spreads.

Remember: With great computational power comes great responsibility. Build systems that amplify human capability. Create architectures that are understandable, auditable, and aligned with human values.

The age of intelligent systems has begun. Program wisely.

## **Appendix: Quick Reference**

### **Command Patterns**
```bash
# Linear pipeline
cat data | claude -p "Extract" | claude -p "Transform" | claude -p "Load"

# Parallel processing
{ claude -p "Analyze security" < code.py & 
  claude -p "Analyze performance" < code.py & } | wait

# Recursive processing
while [ "$NEXT" != "null" ]; do
  NEXT=$(echo "$DATA" | claude -p "Process and return next_target")
done
```

### **State Management**
```python
# External state pattern
state = {}
while state.get("status") != "complete":
    response = claude(f"State: {state}, Input: {input}")
    state = response["new_state"]
```

### **Effect Execution**
```python
# Safe effect protocol
for effect in response["$effects"]:
    if effect["type"] in ALLOWED_EFFECTS:
        execute_safely(effect)
```

### **The Essential Truth**

You're not just using Claude. You're programming with intelligence itself.
